reads a file containing words, then uses a binary search tree to sort, and store words into nodes. Also adds commands to queue if commands typed before file is read

(1)read "file.txt"  // reads a text file
(2)print           //prints how the binary tree appears, will have where the word is saved, its depth and its parent 
(3)first 	//prints first word in binary tree
(4)last            //prints last word in binary tree
(5)summary          //prints a summary of height of tree, first word, last word, total words, and distinct words
(7)delete           // delete a word from binary tree
(8)levelprint		//prints binary tree depending on how it appears
